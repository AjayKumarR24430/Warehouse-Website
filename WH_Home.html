            <div class="img1" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>Office automation system is the tool that enables data to move from one system to another on its own without human intervention and inaccuracies.</p>
      <p>We are using Ofiice automation tools to help organizations collect, manage, and analyze securely to accomplish everyday tasks and processes. Our office automation systems offer an array of benefits for organizations of every size. Powerful office automation systems reduce manual effort and store a large amount of data in little space. They speed up information retrieval and improve process visibility. On the other hand, we could be watching data flow around on its own- that's automation. </p>
